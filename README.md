# sign-up

This is the Sign-Up form of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form">Odin</a>.

At this time, I already has some experience with CSS and all the little project i've made with <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">FrontEnd Mentor</a>.

The "difficult" part was to switch to the sign-in form.
